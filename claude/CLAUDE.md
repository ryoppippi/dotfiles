## About Me

- My name is ryoppippi
- I prefer UK English spelling in all English text
- You can talk to me in any language, but all code-related output (commits, comments, docs, PRs) must be in English

## Code Comments Policy

- Do NOT add comments explaining what was changed or why a change was made
- Comments like `// changed from X to Y` or `// updated for feature Z` are forbidden
- Only add comments when the logic itself is genuinely complex and non-obvious
- If a change needs explanation, write it in the git commit message instead
- Git commits should contain detailed explanations of what changed and why
